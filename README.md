## Bruker2nifti

Medical image format converter: from raw [Bruker](http://imaging.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/imaging/FormatBruker) 
ParaVision to [NifTi](https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1), written in Python.

Further information about the motivation can be found [here](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/tree/master/paper).
Code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti).

### Requirements
* Python 2.7+ and the libraries listed in the file [requirements.txt](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/blob/master/requirements.txt).

### Installation
To install the latest (stable) release as a python library via pip, type 
```
pip install bruker2nifti
```
(installing the library inside a [virtualenvironment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) is warmly recommended).

To install the current development version, please see the 
[wiki-installing](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Installing-latest-updates-and-in-development-mode) page. 

### Usage:

The converter can be accessed via: 
+ Python command shell, 
+ Command Line Utility (CLI) to integrate it in a bash script,
+ Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Moreover, a launcher can be automatically created to access the GUI with no-Python knowledge required.  

#### Python command shell
After installing the stable release with `pip install bruker2nifti`, access the Python command shell typing `python` (or `ipython` if the 
[interactive command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPython) shell is preferred), then import bruker2nifti with
```
import bruker2nifti
```
An example can be found in [wiki-example](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki/Examples) 

#### Command Line utility
After installing bruker2nifti with `pip install bruker2nifti`, type `bruker2nifti -h` at the prompt to access the
 help of the CLI.

<!--
#### Accessing the Command Line Utility without installing
If you prefer to access the command line utility without installing the library on your python environment,
you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/releases) or the 
[development version](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti) on your system, then add it to the python path
with `PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:path-to-bruker2nifti-repository"` and access the help of the CLI via  

+ `python parsers/bruker2nii.py -h`

Where the invoked Python is a distribution provided with the [required libraries](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/blob/master/requirements.txt). .
-->

#### Open the Graphical User Interface (GUI)
After installing bruker2nifti with `pip install bruker2nifti`, type `bruker2nifti -h` at the prompt to access the
 help of the CLI.
```
bruker2nifti_gui
```
This will open the graphical user interface:

![gui_example](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/blob/master/screenshots/gui_example.jpg)

#### Open the GUI and convert data for non-Python developers
Download the repository as a .zip from the [release page](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/releases) 
for the stable version or from the [repository home page](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti) for the latest 
development version via **clone or download** green button.
Unzip the donwloaded file and double click on the file `run_setupper_MAC` in the `GUI` folder inside the project.

After the automatic installation of a virtualenvironment with the required libraries, if everything worked 
(see below for troubleshooting), you will find a new file called 'OpenGUIbru2nii' in the code structure. 

Double click on this launcher: will open the graphical user interface. 

Keep the terminal open while doing the conversion, as there you will see the steps and the output of the different
conversion steps.
The launcher can be moved around in the user system. If you need to move the folder where you donwloaded the code, you will need to re-create the 
launcher from the new code location.

#### Further examples and troubleshooting:

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/wiki) page for more examples and real data applications.
If something went wrong please raise an issue in the [issue page of the repository](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/issues).

### Testing
Unit testing with [nosetest](http://pythontesting.net/framework/nose/nose-introduction/).
After installing the latest development version, type `nosetests` to run the tests.   
Some of the tests are based on an open dataset Bruker images downloadable with the repo, in the folder 
[test_data](https://github.com/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti/tree/master/test_data).
Current deployment version undergoes continuous integration on [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/SebastianoF/bruker2nifti).
